In this directory I am comparing the performance of fmath::exp, fmath::fexp_v, and std::exp. Calls to the various functions are in comp.cpp, and the C headers are in comp.h. These get compiled into comp.so, for use in Python, and then are recompiled along with thec.c into exec, which is an executable that does an actual speed test timing the function calls on a long array of floats.
